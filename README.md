# Train-Scheduler
Train Scheduler Homework by Cara Crotty


This is a real time train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

The project is useful because it provides an example of languages/technologies I learned and show what I can do as a developer. It is using Firebase, JQuery, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

For questions or concerns, please go to my website at carafelise.com or send an email at admin@caracrotty.com. I maintain and developed this project.
